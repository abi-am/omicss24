# Grapevine Project

In this project, we will reanalyze data from [this publication](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2024.1386225/full). The study focuses on identifying genetic markers in the grapevine genome associated with the resistance to downy mildew (DM) and powdery mildew (PM). DM and PM are fungal diseases that significantly affect grapevines, leading to substantial crop losses. Breeding grapevines for resistance to these diseases is crucial for sustainable viticulture. The researchers used Genome-Wide Association Analysis (GWAS) to identify Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with resistance. The study successfully identified new loci linked to DM and PM resistance.

In this project, we will replicate the main steps of the study, which include:

- **Data Preprocessing** - Filtering SNPs and samples according to the provided pipeline.
- **PCA Analysis** - Conducting Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore genetic variation.
- **ADMIXTURE Analysis** - Performing ADMIXTURE analysis to determine population structure.
- **GWAS Analysis** - Conducting GWAS to identify SNPs associated with DM and PM resistance in grapevines.
- **Functional Annotation** - Annotating the SNPs significantly associated with resistance.
